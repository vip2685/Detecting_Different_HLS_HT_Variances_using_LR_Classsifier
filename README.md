# Detecting_Different_HLS_HT_Variances_using_LR_Classsifier

The HLS-Trojan dataset consists of several features derived from different IP core designs. Detailed descriptions of these IPs, including their mathematical transfer characteristics and corresponding control data flow graphs (CDFGs), are openly available here (in IP design details PDF). The set of hardware IP benchmarks includes a test case design, sharpening filter, edge detection, blur filter, convolutional layer, FIR, LED filter, DCT,embossment filter, cardiac pacemaker etc. These benchmarks represent widely used applications in the fields of digital signal processing (DSP), medical systems, and multimedia processing, as referenced in [6], [9], [10], [12]. Consequently, the feature extraction block generated unique 24 features (FNo-In and FTr-In) along with the resulting dataset, which is available in [11]. Here, non-infected designs are defined as NoI, and seven SOTA Trojan variances are defined as TI1 (PD-HT), TI2 (DoS-HT),TI3 (BE-HT),TI4 (DA-HT),TI5 (F-HT),TI6 (TB-HT), and TI7 (TST-HT) [2], [6], [9], [10], [12]. Fig. 4 shows the extracted 24 unique features of different HLS IP designs. As shown in Fig. 4, non-infected IP designs consist of 14 unique features and HLS Trojan infected IP designs consist of 11 unique features. For example, TST-HT (TI7) contains the following 18 features: 4*1 Mux, 8*1 Mux, 16*1 Mux, 32*1 Mux, 1*2 DeMux, 1*4 DeMux, 1*8 DeMux, 1*16 DeMux, 1*32 DeMux, Latch, Adder, Subtractor, Multiplier, 2*1 Mux, Comparator, Memory, Up-counter, Multiple instances of Nx1 Mux output acting as inputs to 2x1 Mux.
